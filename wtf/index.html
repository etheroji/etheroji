            <p>Etheroji: where you can buy and sell Emojis using Ethereum Smart Contracts. Simply select your choice of Emoji on the site, pay your Ether and then add the link of your choice, so other visitors clicking on it will be directed to your site*.</p>
            <p>Your ownership is recorded on the Ethereum blockchain and through the power of Smart Contracts if someone else wants to then buy your Emoji then you will automatically receive your original Ether value back, along with a 20% profit. The Smart Contract controls the price of each Emoji, doubling it each time they are purchased (although keep in mind that it may be that no one wants to buy the Emoji after you – so no returns are guaranteed).</p>
            <p>A Smart Contract is a contract coded into the blockchain that is enforced based on a set of rules. While there are plenty of code and theoretical examples available, few are active or do anything average users might understand. Etheroji changes all of that, providing a fun demonstration of this exciting new technology open to anyone with an Ethereum wallet. The Contract is open sourced and <a href="#where-can-i-check">available to view below</a>.</p>
            <p>Etheroji demonstrates the power of Smart Contract technology, but will also allow us to fund an office kitten (and, all being well, eventually cat). For more details check out the FAQ below</p>

            <h3><a name="im-a-beginner" href="#im-a-beginner">I’m  a complete beginner! How do I get some Ether?</a></h3>
            <p>First thing is to go to an exchange where you can use fiat (normal money like Dollars, Euros or Pounds) to buy your Ether. If you’re new to all of this we’d suggest <a href="https://www.coinbase.com">Coinbase</a> as it acts both as an exchange AND a wallet – i.e. you can both buy and store your Ether there. Also, as with any online financial activities, we’d recommend a strong password, and that you turn on their 2 Factor authentication (which means you either receive a text message with a code or have the Google App on your phone to generate one – each time you login).</p>

            <h3><a name="ive-got-ether" href="#ive-got-ether">I’ve got some Ether, now how do I buy an Emoji?</a></h3>
            <p>You will need to get a browser plug-in to buy your Emoji. For this we’d recommend using Mozilla Firefox or Google’s Chrome browser and installing the Metamask plug-in from this link <a href="https://metamask.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://metamask.io</a> (again alternatives are available). This will allow you to pay, but also provides your identity for the Smart Contract to confirm your ownership of the link you submit – it also means you can get paid if someone else then buys your Emoji.</p>

            <h3><a name="what-is-web3" href="#what-is-web3">What is Web3?</a></h3>
            <p>There is a fair amount of discussion around this, however in this context its a short-hand for websites that support payments using cryptocurrencies and tokens like Ethereum and for this you'll need to have a browser that supports it. You've probably been directed here as you tried to buy an Emoji and the message said you don't have a Web3 enabled browser. We'd recommend using Chrome or Firefox and the Metamask plug-in. Read on in our exciting WTF for more info on setting these up and how to use them.</p>

            <h3><a name="learn-more" href="#learn-more">Where can I learn more about Ether?</a></h3>
            <p>This Quora page has some good info on Ether and how if differs from Bitcoin - <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-Ethereum-and-how-is-it-different-from-Bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.quora.com/What-is-Ethereum-and-how-is-it-different-from-Bitcoin</a>.</p>

            <h3><a name="something-to-spend" href="#something-to-spend">Want something to spend your ETH on?</a></h3>
            <p>How about buying an Emoji on Etheroji.com</p>

            <h3><a name="why-would-you" href="#why-would-you">Why would you do that?</a></h3>
            <p>You can pick your emoji that then appears on Etheroji.com and add a link of your choosing.</p>

            <h3><a name="then-what" href="#then-what">Then what?</a></h3>
            <p>You will own that Emoji and your ownership and choice of URL destination are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. If someone else wants to buy it you get back the Ethereum you paid for it +20%. However, we are obliged to remind you that there is no guarantee that someone else will ever want to buy it.</p>

            <h3><a name="why-did-you" href="#why-did-you">Why did you do this?</a></h3>
            <p>Etheroji is a fun experiment with Ethereum blockchain technology and demonstrate the power of Smart Contracts. Its also a chance for you to drive traffic to the URL of your choice and potentially profit if others decide to buy your Emoji from you.</p>

            <h3><a name="can-i-stop" href="#can-i-stop">Can I stop someone from buying my Emoji?</a></h3>
            <p>No, but you can always buy it back if you want it that badly.</p>

            <h3><a name="how-are-prices-set" href="#how-are-prices-set">How are the prices set for the Emojis?</a></h3>
            <p>Thanks to the Smart Contract the prices are fixed, they double each time an Emoji is sold.</p>

            <h3><a name="how-many-different" href="#how-many-different">How many different Emojis are for sale?</a></h3>
            <p>Currently we've got 1088 emojis on offer.  Keep your eye out for new ones...</p>

            <h3><a name="what-is-smart-contract" href="#what-is-smart-contract">What is a Smart Contract?</a></h3> It is a contract coded into the blockchain that is enforced based on a set of rules. For Etheroji it sets the price of the Emojis and ensures that the previous holder gets paid when their Emoji is sold.</p>

            <h3><a name="do-you-accept-any-urls" href="#do-you-accept-any-urls">Do you accept any URLs?</a></h3>
            <p>We reserve the right to remove emoji links if they are pointed at abusive, illegal or unsuitable sites and replace them with something to do with cats. Everyone likes cats.</p>

            <h3><a name="what-will-you-do" href="#what-will-you-do">What will you do with any Ether that you earn?</a></h3>
            <p>We’re planning on getting an office cat, we’ve always wanted a cat.</p>

            <h3><a name="where-can-i-check" href="#where-can-i-check">Where can I check the contract?</a></h3>
            <p>You can find our contract at <code>0x1b9c123c28dcef6f91f55b38743d9958661f84aa</code> on the <code>mainnet</code> network.
            <p><a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x1b9c123c28dcef6f91f55b38743d9958661f84aa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">View the contract on Etherscan</a>.</p>

            <h3><a name="ethereum-vs-ether" href="#ethereum-vs-ether">What is the difference between Ethereum and Ether?</a></h3>
            <p>The simplest explanation is that Ethereum is the network and Ether is the crypto currency unit that you spend. There are better, and more technical, explanations available via your preferred search engine.</p>

            <h3><a name="why-order-changing" href="#why-order-changing">Why is the order of the Emojis changing?</a></h3>
            <p>The display of Emojis on the page is dynamic. When an emoji is purchased, it will move above those which are cheaper. This means that those displayed first are the most expensive</p>

            <h3><a name="bought-but-nothing-happened" href="#bought-but-nothing-happened">I bought an Emoji but nothing has happened?</a></h3>
            <p>It can take a little while for the purchase to process, so give it five minutes before you start rage tweeting.</p>

            <h3><a name="do-i-own-the-emoji-everywhere" href="#do-i-own-the-emoji-everywhere">Do I own the Emoji everywhere?</a></h3>
            <p>No, all you are buying is the right to add the link of your choice to an Emoji on the Etheroji website. This doesn’t give you the rights to go around telling people that you own the poo emoji, or writing to the people who made the Emoji movie asking for your share of the profits.</p>

            <h3><a name="is-this-an-ico" href="#is-this-an-ico">Is this an ICO?</a></h3>
            <p>No, you are buying the right to have the link of your choice attached to an Emoji displayed on our site. Someone else may then chose to buy the same Emoji in which case you will get your Ether back + 20%. But keep in mind that they may not, in which case you’ll just get traffic sent to the link of your choice as people click on that emoji.</p>

            <h3><a name="typed-the-link-wrong" href="#typed-the-link-wrong">I’ve typed in the link wrong when I bought the Emoji – can I get it changed?</a></h3>
            <p>Once you’ve bought the Emoji it is set in stone on the blockchain, so you can’t make any edits. Unless you want to buy the Emoji again.</p>

            <h3><a name="why-have-i-been-charged-more" href="#why-have-i-been-charged-more">Why have I been charged more than the amount the Emoji is priced at?</a></h3>
            <p>Because of the way the Ethereum network operates you will be charged a transaction fee for completing your purchase. You will be quoted the maximum "gas" amount required by metamask before you hit the green approve button (it may end up being less than this). This will also mean that you may receive a message that you don't have enough funds in your metamask account to make a transaction even if you have enough for the quoted price. This is all standard to Ethereum and frankly a bit confusing - but hey we're all learning as we go here!</p>
